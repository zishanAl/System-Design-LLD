## Encapsulation

### Definition
Encapsulation means bundling data and the methods
that operate on that data into a single unit (a class)
and restricting direct access to the data.

---

### In Simple Words
- Hide internal data
- Expose only what is necessary
- Protect object state from misuse

---

### Why Encapsulation is Required
Without encapsulation:
- Anyone can change internal state
- Objects can enter invalid states

Encapsulation ensures:
- Data safety
- Controlled state changes
- Protection of business rules

---

### Real-World Applications
- Banking systems (balance protection)
- Authentication systems (password hiding)
- Libraries and frameworks (safe APIs)
- Large codebases (safe collaboration)

---

### Key Idea
Encapsulation is not about making variables private.
It is about protecting invariants and enforcing rules.
