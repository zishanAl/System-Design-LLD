## Encapsulation

### Definition
Encapsulation means bundling data and the methods
that operate on that data into a single unit (a class)
and restricting direct access to the data.

---

### In Simple Words
- Hide internal data
- Expose only what is necessary
- Protect object state from misuse

---

### Why Encapsulation Matters
Without encapsulation:
- Anyone can modify internal data
- Object state becomes inconsistent
- Bugs are hard to track

With encapsulation:
- Data is protected
- Code is easier to maintain
- Changes are safer and localized

---

### Key Idea
Make data members private
and control access using public methods.
