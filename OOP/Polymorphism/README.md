## Polymorphism

### What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism allows different objects to respond
differently to the same function call through a common interface.

---

### Key Idea
Same interface.
Different behavior.
Decided at runtime.

---

### Why Polymorphism Matters
- Removes conditional logic
- Enables extensibility
- Works naturally with inheritance

---

### Important Notes
- Requires base-class pointers or references
- Requires virtual functions in C++
- Behavior is resolved at runtime

---

### Key Takeaway
Polymorphism is not enforced.
It is achieved through correct design.
