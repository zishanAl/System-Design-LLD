## Abstraction

### What is Abstraction?
Abstraction focuses on exposing only essential behavior
while hiding implementation details.

---

### Core Idea
The user interacts with *what* the system does,
not *how* it does it.

---

### How Abstraction is Achieved in C++
- Abstract classes
- Pure virtual functions

---

### Why Abstraction Matters
- Encourages loose coupling
- Supports extensibility and maintainability

---

### Key Takeaway
Abstraction defines **what an object does**, not **how it does it**.

---

### Summary
Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details while exposing only the behavior that users need to interact with. It works like a simplified control panel, allowing users to perform actions without understanding the internal complexity of the system. By defining what functionality is available rather than how it is implemented, abstraction reduces complexity and keeps large systems easier to understand, extend, and maintain.
