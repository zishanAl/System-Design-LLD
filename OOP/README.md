## Why Study Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming is not about syntax or language features.
It is a methodology used in the industry to manage complexity in
large, long-lived software systems.

### 1. Easier to Evolve
OOP helps structure code into independent units with clear responsibilities.
This makes it easier to add new features or change existing behavior
without affecting unrelated parts of the system.

---

### 2. Safer to Refactor
Encapsulation and clear abstractions limit the impact of changes.
Developers can refactor internal implementation safely as long as
the public interface remains unchanged.

---

### 3. Reducing Risk of Errors
By hiding internal state and enforcing rules through well-defined methods,
OOP prevents invalid states and accidental misuse of objects,
reducing runtime bugs and unexpected behavior.

---

### 4. Extensibility Without Touching Existing Code
Using abstraction and polymorphism, new functionality can be added
by introducing new implementations instead of modifying existing logic.
This aligns with the Open/Closed Principle and minimizes regression risks.

---

### 5. Helping Developers Work Together
Clear contracts (interfaces and abstractions) allow multiple developers
or teams to work independently on different parts of the system.
This improves collaboration and reduces merge conflicts in large codebases.

### Key Takeaway
OOP exists to manage change, reduce risk, and enable teams to build
and maintain complex software systems efficiently.
