# System Design – Low Level Design (LLD)

This repository documents my learning journey in **Low-Level Design (LLD)**,
focusing on writing clean, extensible, and interview-ready designs.

The goal of this repository is not just to implement solutions,
but to understand **why certain designs are better than others**.

All concepts are demonstrated using **simple, practical, and runnable examples**.

---

## 📌 What this repository contains

Each concept or problem is explained using:
- ❌ A **wrong or naive design** (common mistakes)
- ✅ A **correct and improved design**
- 📝 A short explanation describing the **problem, reasoning, and improvement**

This approach helps in understanding both **design intent** and **trade-offs**.

---

## 🧱 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each principle contains:
- `wrong.cpp`
- `correct.cpp`
- `README.md` with a short explanation

---

### 2️⃣ Core OOP Concepts
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

These sections focus on how core OOP concepts are applied
correctly in real-world low-level design.

---

### 3️⃣ Design Patterns
- Factory
- Strategy
- Observer
- Singleton
- (More to be added as learning progresses)

Each pattern is explained with a clear problem-solution approach.

---

### 4️⃣ LLD Interview Problems
- Parking Lot
- BookMyShow
- Logger
- Cache
- (More systems will be added over time)

These problems focus on **object modeling, extensibility,
and real interview scenarios**.

---

## 🛠 Languages Used
- **C++** (primary language for LLD practice)
- **Java** (may be added later for comparison and interview preparation)

---

## 🎯 Why I built this repository
- To build a strong foundation in **Low-Level Design**
- To maintain a **personal repository for revision and long-term reference**
- To document LLD concepts in a clear, structured way that may help others
- To treat this repository as a **professional engineering notebook** that evolves with learning

This repository will continue to evolve as I deepen my understanding
of system design concepts.

---

## 📈 Future Scope
- Advanced LLD problems
- More design patterns
- Comparative designs in C++ and Java
- Transition towards High-Level Design (HLD)
